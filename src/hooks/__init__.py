"""
Supports the import of plugins.

There are existing plugins and activated plugins.
Existing plugins have to be stored in the folder $HOME/.config/tasker/plugins.
The activated plugins are moved to the plugins package, but for this, you have to use the
Plugins tab of the Preferences menu.

If you need an example plugin you can get it [here](https://github.com/flachica/tasker-plugins).
